# Roles:
- Ian: Scrum master

- Jason: Frontend
- Kyle: Backend

# Ideas:
## Idea 1:
- Create a program that can match facial expressions with the corresponding emoji
    - This would require us to use tensorflow
    - It is possible that we could also use flags instead of facial expressions
        - Train tensorflow to correctly match the flag inputted to the country
## Idea 2:
- Create a program that can modify images
    - Gray scale
    - Pixelate
    - Blue scale
    - Red scale
    - Size up
    - Size down
    - Etc
